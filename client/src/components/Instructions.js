      <h1>TopBloc Coding Challenge</h1>
      <p>
        You're tasked with creating a web application for Randy's Candies, a
        local candy store in Chicago. Randy, the owner, wants the application to
        do three things:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Display items that are almost out of stock (at less than 25%
          capacity)
        </li>
        <li>
          Allow him to input how many of each of those items he wants to
          re-order
        </li>
        <li>Determine the lowest total cost of re-ordering those items</li>
      </ol>
      The web application consists of a Java backend and React frontend.
      <h2>Backend</h2>
      <h3>Workbooks</h3>
      The backend contains two workbooks, <code>Inventory.xlsx</code> and{" "}
      <code>Distributors.xlsx</code>.<code>Inventory.xlsx</code> contains the
      items in the store: their SKU, name, amount in stock, and the capacity
      in the store for that item. <code>Distributors.xlsx</code> contains
      three worksheets, one for each distributor, which list the items the
      distributor sells: their SKU, item name, and price. Note that each
      distributor will not necessarily have all the items that Randy sells at
      his store.{" "}
      <p>
        It is up to you to find a Java library for reading workbooks, add it
        as a Maven dependency, and use it to read in the provided workbooks.
      </p>
      <h3>Endpoints</h3>
      <p>
        The backend exposes two endpoints at <code>
          http://localhost:4567
        </code>{" "}
        using the <a href="https://sparkjava.com/">Java Spark</a> library:{" "}
        <code>/low-stock</code> and <code>/restock-cost</code>. The{" "}
        <code>/low-stock</code> endpoint should return only the items that are
        at less than 25% capacity. The <code>/restock-cost</code> endpoint
        should return the lowest total cost for Randy to restock. The lowest
        total cost is determined by the lowest available price across different
        distributors. The items to restock and their amounts should be provided
        in the request body from the frontend.
      </p>
      <h2>Frontend</h2>
      <p>
        The frontend will be responsible for utilizing the Java endpoints to
        display the low-stock items and calculating the cost of restocking
        items. You will need to add the appropriate event listeners to the
        buttons for using these endpoints.
      </p>
      <p>
        You will also need to create a component to display a table row showing
        the item data. This component should also have an input element where
        Randy can type in the amount he wants to restock.
      </p>
